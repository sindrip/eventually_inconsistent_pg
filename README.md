# EventuallyInconsistent PG

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to run some distributed tests with [ex_unit_cluster](https://github.com/sindrip/ex_unit_cluster).

It implements a subset of the `:pg` API, with the added feature of
being eventually inconsistent as opposed to eventually consistent!
